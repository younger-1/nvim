*There are only two kinds of people in the world, the ones like use vim and the ones don't know they like vim*

## Fast

I didn’t think “fast” mattered, but I installed it and... WOW! yeah, fast matters!

## Keyboard centric

g;

cgn

## Builtin

- persistent undo cross session
- spell check with semantic support (e.g. only in comment)

You may gotten these functionalities in other editor/IDE by installing extensions.
You could get them in nvim for free.

## Extensibility

plugin is just some lines of code in the right place

do task with filetype you specific, on event you want. Automatically and easily

### diffview.nvim

Show file history of multiple files: `DiffviewFileHistory :foo/**/bar`. Git pathspec is supported (see `man gitglossary`)
LSP works normally in diff mode when possible
